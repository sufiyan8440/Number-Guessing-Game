# Number-Guessing-Game
I've developed a beginner level number guessing using random package in python. Very first project built in my first year of CS engineering and planned to deploy in this new github account.

Step-by-step algorithm:
-> User inputs the lower bound and upper bound of the range.
-> The compiler generates a random integer between the range and store it in a variable for future references.
-> For repetitive guessing, a while loop will be initialized.
-> If the user guessed a number which is greater than a randomly selected number, the user gets an output “Try Again! You guessed too high“
-> Else If the user guessed a number which is smaller than a randomly selected number, the user gets an output “Try Again! You guessed too small”
-> And if the user guessed in a minimum number of guesses, the user gets a “Congratulations! ” Output.
-> Else if the user didn’t guess the integer in the minimum number of guesses, he/she will get “Better Luck Next Time!” output.
